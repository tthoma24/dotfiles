# My dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles for configuration of my macOS and Linux systems.

I install these with [Jeff Geerling's ansible-role-dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-dotfiles) as a part of my [macOS Setup Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/tthoma24/ansible-macos-playbook) or by hand as needed. Please feel free to fork and use these a examples and starting points for your own.
